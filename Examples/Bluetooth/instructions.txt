To emulate those Bluetooth LE peripheral operations in Windows, Windows store has an application called Bluetooth LE
Explorer which is able to simulate different kind of Bluetooth GATT profiles as a peripheral.
Heart Rate Service profile is one of those. Select Virtual Peripheral, then Heart Rate Service
and remember to switch Discoverable and Connectable selection to on.

After this, you may connect to the heartrate monitor with your device.
